README


Libraries Included
  -----------

<sys/stat.h> 	 -  For mode constants

 <fcntl.h>  	 -  For O_* constants
 
 <unistd.h>		 -  standard symbolic constants and types
 
 <pthread.h>	 -  threads
 
 <semaphore.h>	 -  semaphores
 
 <sys/errno.h> 	 -  It defines macros for reporting and retrieving error conditions through error codes stored in a static memory location called errno (short for "error number").

 <sys/types.h> 	 -  types are defined for alignment with the POSIX Realtime Extension.

 <sys/ipc.h> 	 -  used by three mechanisms for interprocess communication (IPC): messages,   	semaphores and shared memory. 

 <sys/msg.h> 	 -	defines the following constant and members of the structure msqid_ds.

 <stdio.h> 		 -	positive integral constant expressions

 <stdlib.h> 	 -	Standard library

 <string.h> 	 -	must be provided for use with an ISO C compiler.

 <signal.h> 	 -	Allows me to have a signal listener to catch a control+C

  What is it?
  -----------
	This program simulates the producer consumer problem and solves them with semaphores



 How to compile
  -----------
	Type make and press enter.


  How to Run
  -----------
	Type ./prodcon <int time, int producers, int consumers> and press enter.(no inequalities of commas, just e.g.  ./prodcon 5 3 2


  How to End
  -----------
	The first perimeter "time" will end the program in that many seconds. Or control + C
